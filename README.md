# Last-Mage
This is a Vampire Survivor -like game. 

You play as a mage fighting against hordes of enemies. Your goal is to survive as long as possible and kill as many as enemy as you can.

-You can move with WASD or arrow buttons.
-By pressing "P" you can pause the game and check your current upgrades and weapons.

Note:
-Save system implemented but later on not used because of the design change. After the change there are no permanent upgrades so there is no need for save system. Save system codes are commented out and still exists.
